Use this tool to store any document on the Ethereum Blockchain. Documents are never stored on our server and are simply passed along to Ethereum.

If the file is too big for a block on the chain, it will be split into multiple parts (which can be combined back later)

Estimated cost is below the upload box and is for blockchain gas only (no additional fees are charged)

Note 1: MetaMask will give a higher gas estimate than this page estimates. The MetaMask gas estimates are currently incorrect. Please disregard the MetaMask estimate and refer to the estimate on this site instead. We intend to work with the MetaMask team to get this addressed.

Note 2: Ethereum cannot handle much more than 3kb of document data per block. Although this tool will split the file across multiple blocks, MetaMask will ask for manual approval on each file part. This would result in many manual approvals being required for large files. This is a MetaMask limitation and we will work with MetaMask to address this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
